          <p class="text-justify">The poverty cycle in India is very apparent; especially in small cities like Visakhapatnam. The idea that "I will be poor because my parents were poor" is something that is generationally engraved in the minds of young people here. Children have either forgotten or never learned how to dream, and the few who do, only dream of getting a job. Forget dreaming of becoming a dancer or an actor. Survival is life for many of them. We do more than just teach English; we inspire our students to raise their sights and to see themselves in a larger world of possibilities. This is where change begins &mdash; a dream.</p>

          <p class="text-justify">Needed essentials of clothes and hygiene kits “feed [people] for a day.” Research shows that "giving" things away in 3rd world countries as an act of humanitarian relief backfires without education. Communities have gotten used to these "free" gifts and simply wait for the next batch to come. Education is earned through KVM. Students are qualified for the program and are required to contribute funds for their education. KVM funds are supplemental scholarships. Parallel to our English curriculum, students are taught life lesson exercises that enable them to see options in their lives with which they will construct their own future.</p>

          <p class="text-justify">We are looking for chain breakers; young people who will change the direction of succeeding generations. This standard applies for both our students and our field volunteers.   We endeavor to provide an unforgettable experience for our field volunteers whose focus is to measurably change the lives of the young people they teach. We inspire our students and give them the tools they need, to make the changes in their lives they want to see. Our mission for KVM Graduates is not only their success in the world, but also to expand KVM’s borders and enable them to assist teaching succeeding classes of students.</p>

The High School student track is a charitable arm of KVM that teaches novice English ability students.

He wishes to express gratitude to all of those who have helped make these dreams come true. Truly we are dream creators and achievers.

                        Nic was born in Bern, Switzerland to adventurous American parents. Raised in Orem, UT, Nic excelled in scholastics, piano performance and conducted the Utah Symphony at age 11.  He met Taylor Ottesen when they were 13 years old at a summer cross-country camp. Something about the heat and exhaustion of that experience forged a friendship that has now lasted more than ten years. Nic attends Brigham Young University, speaks French and German, is a social media marketer and plays drums in a rock band called Red Yeti.
