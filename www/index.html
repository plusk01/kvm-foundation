          <p class="text-justify">The poverty cycle in India is very apparent; especially in small cities like Visakhapatnam. The idea that "I will be poor because my parents were poor" is something that is deeply engraved in the minds of people here. Children have forgotten how to dream, and the few who still do dream of just getting a good job. Forget dreaming of becoming a dancer or an actor. Survival is life for many of these people. We want to do more than just teach English; we want to inspire these people to raise their sights and to dream. This is were change begins &mdash; a simple dream.</p>

          <p class="text-justify"><i>Give</i> a man a fish and you feed him for a day; <i>teach</i> a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime. Research is showing that "giving" things away in 3rd world countries as an act of humanitarian relief is beginning to backfire. Instead of giving poor people clothes or hygiene kits hoping that people learn to help themselves, we are finding that these people have gotten used to these "free" gifts and simply wait for the next batch to come. We are not giving anything away to the people here in India. We are teaching them a skill with which they will construct their own future.</p>

          <p class="text-justify">We are looking for chain breakers. We as KVM understand taht we can only help those who are willing to help themselves. Although we hope that our volunteers have an unforgettable experience, our main focus is on measurably changing the lives of the people we teach. We inspire our students and give them the tools they need, then allowing them to make the changes in their lives they want to see.</p>

Foreign countries are increasingly realizing that English is a vital key to success in the employment field and therefore are implementing it more and more, even in the poorest of schools. Our program is made to teach English to those individuals who already have marketable skills such as engineering or law degrees. These are the people in need of the caliber of English taht we are capable of teaching.  KVM does <i>not</i> simply teach basic English to these individuals and then abandon them. We aim to give them profressional training in English communication as an aid to them as they their various educational institutions and step into the work field.</p> -->

            <h3>Impoverished High School Students</h3>
            <!-- <p>Although these students will not speak English well enough to make a significant improvement on their ability to speak English, we have found that we can still make a significant impact on these students.</p> -->

                        Taylor Ottesen is a student at Brigham Young University working on a degree in Neuroscience and Chemistry. He has a true love for traveling and cultures. His travels around the world stopped him on two different occasions in India - both of which were life changing. His passion to help people has helped lead to the founding of KVM Foundation and his continued involvement as a board member of KVM. He wishes to express gratitude to all of those who have helped make these dreams come true. Truly we are dream creators and achievers.

Something about the heat and exhaustion of that experience forged a friendship that has now lasted more than ten years.  Nic speaks French and plays drums in a rock band called Red Yeti.
