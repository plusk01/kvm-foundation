                    <p>
                        Taylor Ottesen is a student at Brigham Young University working on a degree in Neuroscience and Chemistry. He has a true love for traveling and cultures. His travels around the world stopped him on two different occasions in India - both of which were life changing. His passion to help people has helped lead to the founding of KVM Foundation and his continued involvement as a board member of KVM. He wishes to express gratitude to all of those who have helped make these dreams come true. Truly we are dream creators and achievers.

                    <p>
                        Nic was born in Bern, Switzerland to adventurous American parents. Raised in Orem, UT, Nic excelled in scholastics, piano performance and conducted the Utah Symphony at age 11.  He met Taylor Ottesen when they were 13 years old at a summer cross-country camp. Something about the heat and exhaustion of that experience forged a friendship that has now lasted more than ten years. Nic attends Brigham Young University, speaks French and German, is a social media marketer and plays drums in a rock band called Red Yeti.

                        Josh Petersen graduated Cum Laude in International Business at UVU where he played Rugby.  He enjoys sports, traveling, spending time with family and friends, and serving others. He is in the process of launching a business.    Josh learned to help others at a young age as he served the homeless with his family, but that desire grew upon seeing the horrible conditions that people live in as he served a 2 year LDS mission in Honduras.  In Honduras he taught Spanish and English classes and built homes.   His favorite food group is chocolate.

Although he is half-Peruvian himself, culture shock did not even begin to describe the way he felt after seeing the conditions that people lived in. Since then, he has traveled to several third world countries including Bolivia, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Mexico, at times performing dance in National Theaters and at other times sleeping on street corners. He is currently pursuing a degree in business management at Brigham Young University.
