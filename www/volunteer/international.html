            <h3>Application Instructions</h3>

            <p>To apply, download <a href="international.pdf">this application</a> and e-mail the responses to <a href="mailto:apply@kvmfoundation.org">apply@kvmfoundation.org</a> with your desired position as the subject.</p>

            <br>

            <p><strong>Application Deadline: Wednesday October 15th, 2014 at 11:59pm MST.</strong></p>

            <br><br>

            <h3>Here is some basic information you should be aware of before applying</h3>

            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                KVM is a student run organization that endeavors to create change in the mindset and skillset of children aboard. We are expanding quickly and hope to be expanding to other countries in Asia and South America in the next couple of years. For this to happen we need committed, hardworking, innovative, and adaptive interns. 
              </li>
              <li>
                You will be placed in a “small city” of about 3 million inhabitants (yes this is small for India). Vishakhapatnam is found in the state of Andhra Pradesh and it is located on the Eastern coast of India.  
              </li>
              <li>
                The local language spoken in Andhra Pradesh is called Telugu (tell – oo – goo). As part of your immersion you will learn how to communicate basic ideas in Telugu. It is up to you how much you decide to learn, but you will need to develop a very basic functioning use of the language.
              </li>
              <li>
                Plane fare can vary by as much as $2000 so be prepared for a bit for a variable final cost. The average cost for a plane ticket is between $1200 and $1400 but we have seen as much as $2300. The cost of the program will run between $3000-$5000 depending on airfare prices. We have staff to help you arrange travel arrangements and get you the best possible prices for your trip.
              </li>
              <li>
                Because KVM is student run, between 2-5 foreign interns will be the managing team on the ground in India. You will be making important financial, curriculum, and operational decisions on a daily basis. There is a lot of trust put in your hands. “With great power comes great responsibility.” This is not a fun “summer experience” or a semester break. You will be expected to work 6 days a week with a day allotted for travel and leisure. There are many beautiful Hindu temples, the beach, shopping bazaars, and cultural events to participate in during your days off. The other 6 working days will be devoted to teaching English programs in the mornings to and afternoons, as well as networking with local businesses, paperwork, administrative duties, and communication with the Utah administrative office.
              </li>
              <li>
                As discussed, you will be one of the major decision making members of this organization. You will be the face of KVM in India and as such will be expected to be professional at all times. Your actions and decisions will help to determine the future of KVM thus we need trustworthy people who aren’t afraid of hard work or failure.
              </li>
              <li>
                You will be given a week-long vacation time in which you will be able to travel further distances to see locations such as the Taj Mahal, Delhi, Varanasi (the Hindu Mecca) and other places. You will be expected to pay and arrange for these travels.
              </li>
              <li>
                The 2014 fall internship will start on August 10th and run through December 20th. When you arrive, you will be trained by our two current interns for two weeks after which you will be left in charge! At the end of your internship you will be expected to train the next set of interns for a period of 2 weeks before beginning travels around the country.
              </li>
              <li>
                Should you be selected, you will need to apply for an Indian visa IMMEDIATELY. More information will be given to you if you are selected, but this process can be quite lengthy so one of our representatives will help you through the whole application process.
              </li>
              <li>
                While your experience will be extremely rewarding, fun, and even magical, it will be difficult. India is a whole different world. Both men and women who apply will be expected to follow cultural norms found in India and be willing to accept the culture as it is. This is one struggle previous interns have struggled with. We cannot project our Western ideals and values onto the Indian people.
                <ol type="i">
                  <li>
                    Modesty: This means men will be expected to wear long pants whenever you are in public. This can be quite miserable as it can reach well over 100 degrees in many parts of the city, but it sets you apart as an outsider. Women need to cover their shoulders and legs. Tank tops, short shorts, etc. are not acceptable. You will have the opportunity to buy many Indian clothes while you are there and become integrated into the culture.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Physical Contact: It is completely inappropriate for men and women to have any form of physical contact in public. What may be considered completely normal to you (a handshake or a high five) could be considered extremely offensive and even sexual if done between members of the opposite sex. That being said, men will often hold hands or hug as expressions of extreme friendship. It is nothing to do with sexual orientation, simply trust and friendship.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                There are 2 different LDS congregations located in Vishakhapatnam. If you are LDS and would like to participate in these congregations we will make arrangements to do so. There are also several Catholic congregations and other Christian Denominations if you want to participate in your religious services. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Overall, we want you to have FUN! This will be a life changing experience both for you and the people you help. We are confident in saying that this is a once in a lifetime experience and that there is NO OTHER opportunity like this. Many internships allow you to help with basic tasks and decisions, but only a handful give you the training and opportunities to begin the creating process of your own program. We know you will make a difference and see lives changed because of your endeavors. Dream. Educate. Change. This is a movement that cannot be stopped. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Welcome. We hope to get to work with you in the future. 
              </li>
