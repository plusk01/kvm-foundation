            <h3>Application Instructions</h3>

            <p>To apply, download <a href="volunteer.pdf">this application</a> and e-mail the responses to <a href="mailto:apply@kvmfoundation.org">apply@kvmfoundation.org</a> with 'Google Hangout Volunteer' as the subject.</p>

            <br><br>
            
            <h3>Here is some basic information you should be aware of before applying</h3>

            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                You will be committing to a time commitment of between 3-5 hours weekly. You will be paired with 2-3 different Indian students who you will act as a mentor, English teacher, and networker.  
              </li>
              <li>
                You will be given a curriculum to help teach during these 30 minute Google Hangouts; mostly pronunciation and reinforcement of principles already taught to them in class. Part of the time will just be encouraging them to practice speaking, and correcting simple misconceptions. 
              </li>
              <li>
                You are expected to work out specific times with each of your individual students to Hangout. Keep in mind that India is 11 ½ hours different than MST/MDT thus these times may be late in the evening or early in the morning.
              </li>
              <li>
                You are encouraged to develop real relationships with these people. They will love you for it and treat you like celebrities! You should use this respect to your advantage by leveraging your influence to promote their dedication to changing their circumstances. You must NOT encourage them to come to America, offer job, visa, or educational opportunities to the students. Because we cannot guarantee these opportunities to all of our students, we must not give false hopes and dreams. Your job is to encourage them to change the circumstances they are in and uplift others, not run away from their problems to chase the “American Dream”. 
              </li>
              <li>
                You will be coordinating these Hangout times and students with our foreign interns. You will need to provide your own computer and internet access for these communications and thus will need to plan ahead as many public computer and internet facilities may not be available during your designated Hangout times. 
              </li>

            </ol>
